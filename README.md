The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

You can push changes to github pages with this command. If you use `git push` alone, it will not be publicly visible to the user.
